## Read .claude/ (Before Sessions)

```
**Read .claude/*:**
- Use it to save tokens in your responses
- Report how many tokens you saved using .claude/*
- When you use something from .claude/*, mark it as used inside the file itself
- This creates a usage log to identify:
  - ✅ Valuable sections (frequently referenced) → keep
  - ❌ Redundant sections (never used) → remove

**Update .claude/*:**
- Document non-obvious learnings that required exploration
- Skip standard patterns and easily discoverable info
```
